# Introduction

Hi folks, this is my approach on tutorial from this [Phaser 3 introduction tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game).

I wanted to write it in complete typescript, with correct types and fast building speeds.
That's the reason why I use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for instant server and builds.
I also added some bonus code, check them out on the bottom!

If you are starting with Phaser 3 from scratch, then I recommend to read the code from the [first commit](https://github.com/dominik-selmeci/making-your-first-phaser-3-game-with-typescript/commit/4bcae6def8e24ec82c94b865ee9fd9d26f6fdb5b) up to the last one.

# Usage

Run development with instant reload in browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

```
yarn dev
```

Run build. It creates a `dist/` folder, that you can serve on your website.

```
yarn build
```

Run server from the created build

```
yarn preview
```
